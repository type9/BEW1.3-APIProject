Tweet Generator Generator API.

Lets you generate new sentences based off of Twitter handle.

If you like that sentence generated, you can post back to save the tweet in a library.

Other users can choose to generate a tweet based off a twitter handle brand new or from a library of tweets already generated and saved using that handle.

API page would show the most liked fake tweets/handles.

Perhaps add a caching system.
